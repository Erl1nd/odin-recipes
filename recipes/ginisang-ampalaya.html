    <h2>Ginisang Ampalaya (Sauteed Bitter Melon)</h2>
    <p>
        The thought we often associate with “ampalaya” is bitterness and a generally unpleasant taste. And while it is true that this vegetable holds this flavor— after all, it is called a bitter melon— it doesn’t always have to taste unfavorable. Some ampalaya can initially have that overpowering bitterness, but with the right preparations, it can actually taste satisfyingly flavorful and delicious. A classic dish that utilizes this unique flavor is Ginisang Ampalaya.
